**This is completely experimantal library**

Currently, Appium support Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript and C# clients mainly.
Not so active, but Perl and PHP are also available.

In Web world, it is worth to develop test code following their developing languages.
In Mobile world, we have few selections for it since Android requires Java/Kotlin and iOS requres Objective-C/Swift. (Of course, Windows stuff are C#)

Appium is written in JavaScript. Some popular support libraries such as Danger and Cocoapods are written in Ruby. Machine Learning stuff is Python.



(notice)
I heavily understand Espresso for Android and XCUITest for iOS are maintained by Google and Apple as their official automation tools. I have much experience for such framework as well.
If solid Android or iOS developers step into automation world, they also be a good method to implement test code. But sometimes they strongly depend on their internal code of the production layer than Appium tests.

It's trade off thing, but I thought if we have Swift client for iOS, it also helps test/qa/develpment world.

This repository has not stable yet. Has no concrete rodemap. But let me try to prototype the client in Swift.
